ADVENTURE CREATION
NOTES:
- Provide input for all fields. Fields that are greyed out aren't required.

- Customization for buttons are available within cardviews. The field labeled "LEADS TO SCENE" requires a number corresponding to the scenario. 
  The first scenaraio created is scenario 0, the next one after that is scenario 1, and so on.

- The "End" radio button corresponds to a scenario without any buttons. All scenarios are set to normal by default.
