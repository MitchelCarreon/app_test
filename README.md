# Wyrd Choices
An android app dedicated to CYOA (Create Your Own Adventure). This serves as a tool to make text-based games.


## Creating an adventure?
- Provide input for all fields. Fields that are greyed out aren't required.
- Customization for buttons are available within cardviews. The field labeled ***Leads to scene*** requires a number corresponding to the scenario. 
  > The first scenaraio created is scenario 0, the next one after that is scenario 1, and so on.
- The "End" radio button corresponds to a scenario without any buttons. All scenarios are set to normal by default.


## Issues
- [ ] #7
- [ ] Help/Recommender tool for checking valid button references during *Adventure Create*
- [ ] Buttons referencing inexistent scenarios aren't checked.
- [ ] User-created adventures are saved locally but not remotely in database.
